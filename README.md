# Microseismic Detection on Distributed Acoustic Sensing Arrays using Deep Learning from the Utah FORGE Well 16A (78)-32 Hydraulic Stimulation 
 DASEventNet model for detect microseismic from DAS Fiber based on the ResNet network. 

 The silixa DAS data used in this study is collected from the 2022 16A well hydraulic stimulation via https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/1393

Silixa provided a DAS catalog can be accessed via https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/1423

The deep borehole geophone catalog provided by the Geo-Energie Suiss is greatly appreciated especially (Ben Dyer, Dimitrios Karvounis, Falko Bethmann), which could be accessed via https://gdr.openei.org/submissions/1558
